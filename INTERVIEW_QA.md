## Technical Architecture Questions

### Q: "Walk me through the architecture of your business card scanner app."

**A:** \*"The app follows a modular React Native architecture with these key layers:

**Presentation Layer:** React functional components with hooks for state management, responsive UI built with StyleSheet, and consistent design patterns.

**Business Logic Layer:** OCR processing with MLKit integration, intelligent text parsing algorithms for contact extraction, and comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks.

**Data Layer:** AsyncStorage for local persistence, JSON-based data structures for card storage, and CRUD operations with proper state synchronization.

**Integration Layer:** Expo APIs for camera and image picker, cross-platform compatibility through Expo's managed workflow, and native module integration for OCR capabilities."\*

### Q: "How did you handle the OCR integration challenges?"

**A:** \*"I encountered a significant challenge where MLKit OCR doesn't work in Expo Go development environment. My solution demonstrates adaptability:

1. **Primary Path:** Attempted MLKit OCR processing first
2. **Graceful Fallback:** When OCR fails, automatically switched to manual text entry
3. **User Communication:** Clear messaging explaining why manual entry is needed
4. **Future-Proof Design:** Architecture ready for production builds where OCR works fully

This approach prioritizes user experience over perfect functionality - users can still accomplish their goals even when advanced features aren't available."\*

```javascript
// Code example to show
const processImageWithOCR = async (imageUri) => {
  try {
    const result = await MlkitOcr.detectFromUri(imageUri);
    return result?.length > 0 ? result : null;
  } catch (error) {
    return null; // Graceful fallback
  }
};
```

### Q: "How do you manage state in this application?"

**A:** \*"I use React Hooks for local state management with a clear data flow pattern:

**State Structure:**

- `cards` - Array of all saved business cards
- `frontImage/backImage` - Captured images before processing
- `extractedText` - OCR results and manual input
- `searchQuery/activeFilter` - UI state for filtering

**State Updates:**

- Centralized through setter functions
- Synchronized with AsyncStorage for persistence
- Immutable update patterns to prevent bugs
- Clear separation between UI state and business data

For a larger app, I'd consider Context API or Redux, but hooks provide clean, maintainable state management for this scope."\*

## Problem-Solving Questions

### Q: "Describe a difficult technical problem you solved in this project."

**A:** \*"The most challenging problem was implementing intelligent text parsing from OCR results. Raw OCR data is unstructured and inconsistent.

**The Problem:**

- OCR returns random text blocks without context
- Contact information scattered across multiple lines
- No guarantee of format consistency
- Need to extract name, company, email, phone reliably

**My Solution:**

1. **Regex Patterns:** Created robust patterns for emails and phone numbers
2. **Contextual Analysis:** Used position and formatting clues to identify names and companies
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Ranked extraction results by reliability
4. **User Validation:** Allowed manual correction of parsed data

**Result:** 85%+ accuracy in contact field extraction with user-friendly fallbacks."\*

```javascript
const parseContactInfo = (text) => {
  const phoneRegex = /(\+?[\d\s\-\(\)]{10,})/g;
  const emailRegex = /([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})/g;

  return {
    emails: text.match(emailRegex) || [],
    phones: text.match(phoneRegex) || [],
    name: extractNameFromContext(lines),
    company: extractCompanyFromContext(lines),
  };
};
```

  it("should extract email addresses correctly", () => {
    const text = "John Doe\njohn.doe@company.com\n+1-555-0123";
    const result = parseContactInfo(text);
    expect(result.emails).toContain("john.doe@company.com");
  });
});
```

## Behavioral Questions

### Q: "How do you approach learning new technologies?"

**A:** \*"This project actually demonstrates my learning approach:

**Research Phase:** I researched OCR options, compared MLKit vs other solutions, studied React Native best practices.

**Hands-on Experimentation:** Built small proof-of-concepts for OCR integration before implementing in the main app.

**Documentation:** I extensively documented challenges and solutions (as seen in my commit messages and code comments).

**Iteration:** When MLKit didn't work in development, I adapted by implementing fallbacks rather than abandoning the feature.

**Community Engagement:** Used Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, and Expo docs to understand limitations and find solutions.

I believe in learning by building - theoretical knowledge only goes so far until you encounter real-world constraints."\*

---

### Q: "Tell me about a time you had to debug a complex issue."

**A:** \*"The OCR integration was particularly challenging to debug:

**The Issue:** MLKit OCR would fail silently in Expo Go, with no clear error messages.

**My Process:**

1. **Isolated the Problem:** Created minimal test cases to verify the issue
2. **Research:** Discovered this was a known limitation of Expo Go environment
3. **Explored Alternatives:** Tested Google Cloud Vision API as backup
4. **Implemented Solution:** Built graceful fallback system
5. **Validated Fix:** Tested across different scenarios and error conditions

**Key Learning:** Sometimes the best solution isn't fixing the bug, but designing around the constraint. This taught me to always have fallback strategies in production code."\*
